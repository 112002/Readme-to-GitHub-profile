How to add a readme to your GitHub profile

GitHub recently released a feature that allows users to create a profile-level README to display prominently on their GitHub profile.
- <b>Why READMEs?</b>
The GitHub profile-level `README` feature allows more content than the profile bio, supports markdown which means you can play around with the content more visually (Did someone say GIFs!?) and the `README` is significantally more visible as it is placed above pinned repositories and takes up as much space above the fold of the webpage as you like.A solid README is a core-component of well-documented software and often encourages collaboration by sharing helpful context with contributors. In my opinion, a profile-   level README seems like a great extension of a convention a lot of GitHub users are already familiar with. If you're looking to make project-level READMEs more awesome and      helpful check out matiassingers/awesome-readme for resources and examples of compelling `READMEs`.

- <b>How do I create a profile README?</b>
The profile README is created by creating a new repository thatâ€™s the same name as your username. For example, my GitHub username is m0nica so I created a new repository with the name m0nica. Note: at the time of this writing, in order to access the profile README feature, the letter-casing must match your GitHub username.
<br />
1. Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username: https://github.com/new <br />
2. Create a README.md file inside the new repo with content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.)
      `Commit your fancy new README!` <br />
If you're on GitHub's web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo's main branch (i.e., `master` or `main`) which will make it immediately visible on your profile) <br />
3. `Push` changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally i.e., on your computer and not github.com)
